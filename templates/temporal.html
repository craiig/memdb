<h1>Temporal Locality Report</h1>
<h2>How to read these images:</h2>
<p>Temporal Locality visualizations are meant to give a notion of how much data is reused by each subsequent function call invocation. Temporal locality in the program can be visualized as vertical lines or triangles.</p>
<p>The first image shows the current temporal locality in the original program. The second image shows temporal locality if one is able to re-order function calls for better temporal locality (i.e. we can reschedule function calls). This tool sorts by the memory addresses accessed in order by each function. <b>If the sorted function image has significantly improved locality (more vertical lines), then the program will likely benefit from re-ordering the accesses. However, it remains a programming challenge to find the right parameter to sort by, because sorting by addresses accessed is usually infeasible.</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>y-axis: Different function invocations (Each row is a function call)</li>
	<li>x-axis: Addresses in the order they appear in the trace. Each column is a unique memory object and is ordered by appearance in the trace. (Adjacent columns are *not* spatially adjacent).</li>
	<li>Black dots are reads, Red dots are writes</li>
</ul>
